        "\n",
        "ANS-Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a way of writing and organizing computer programs using “objects.” These objects are like real-life things that have properties (like color or size) and can do actions (like move or speak). In OOP, we use classes to create these objects. A class is like a blueprint, and objects are built from that blueprint. OOP helps make code easier to understand, reuse, and fix by keeping related data and actions together. The four main ideas in OOP are: encapsulation (keeping data safe inside an object), inheritance (one class can use things from another class), polymorphism (objects can take many forms or do the same action in different ways), and abstraction (hiding complex details to show only what's needed)."

It defines what the object will be like by listing its properties (called attributes) and the actions it can do (called methods). For example, if you have a class called \"Car,\" it might have properties like color and speed, and actions like drive or stop. You can then use this class to make many car objects, each with their own details. So, a class helps organize code and makes it easier to create and manage similar objects."

Abstraction means hiding the complex parts of code and only showing what is needed. For example, when you drive a car, you don’t need to know how the engine works—just how to use the steering wheel and pedals. Encapsulation means keeping data and methods (actions) inside one unit, like a class, and protecting it from outside changes. It’s like putting important parts of a machine in a box so no one can mess with them directly. So, abstraction hides complexity, and encapsulation hides data to keep it safe."

For example, __init__ is a dunder method that runs when you create a new object, and __str__ defines how the object looks when printed. Another example is __add__, which lets you use the + sign between two objects. These methods help make your classes behave like regular Python types, and Python calls them automatically in certain situations."

For example, if you have a parent class called “Animal” with a method “eat,” and a child class called “Dog,” the Dog class will automatically have the “eat” method too.

You can make variables private by starting their name with an underscore _ (protected) or double underscore __ (private). This tells other programmers not to change them directly. Instead, you use getter and setter methods to safely get or change the values. For example, you might have a method called get_balance() to see the balance and set_balance() to update it. This helps protect the data and keeps the class in control of how it is used."

A class method uses @classmethod and takes cls as its first parameter, which means it works with the class itself, not a specific object. You can use it to change class-level data or create new objects. A static method uses @staticmethod and doesn’t take self or cls. It doesn’t use any class or object data—it’s just a regular function placed inside a class for better organization.

However, unlike some other languages, Python does not support true method overloading directly. If you define the same method name more than once in a class, the last one will replace the others. But you can simulate overloading by using default arguments or *args and **args to accept different types or numbers of inputs. This way, one method can handle many cases based on what is passed to it. So, while Python doesn't have built-in method overloading, it can still be done in a flexible way."

This allows the child class to change or customize how the method works. When the method is called on an object of the child class, Python uses the child’s version, not the parent’s. For example, if a parent class has a method called speak() and the child class has its own speak() method, the child’s method will run when called. Method overriding helps make code more flexible and allows subclasses to behave differently from their parent classes."

It uses @property above a method. This is helpful when you want to control access to a value—like calculating it, checking it, or hiding how it works—while letting users of your class get it in a simple way. You can also use @<property_name>.setter to let the value be updated with rules, and @<property_name>.deleter to delete it safely. So, the property decorator makes your class cleaner and smarter by combining methods with variable-like access."

It can have normal methods and also abstract methods, which are methods without any code inside them—they just define a name and must be written in any child class. To create an abstract class, you use the ABC module and the @abstractmethod decorator. Abstract classes help make sure that all child classes follow a certain structure by forcing them to implement specific methods. This is useful when you want different classes to share common rules or behaviors."

It is usually set inside the __init__() method using self, like self.name. Changing one object’s instance variable does not affect others.

This allows the child class to use features (like methods and variables) from all its parent classes. For example, if you have two classes Teacher and Coach, a new class SportsTeacher can inherit from both to get the abilities of teaching and coaching. Python handles this using something called the Method Resolution Order (MRO), which decides the order in which methods are looked up. Multiple inheritance can be powerful, but it should be used carefully to avoid confusion or conflicts between parent classes."

However, it’s not used very often because Python has a garbage collector that handles memory cleanup automatically.
